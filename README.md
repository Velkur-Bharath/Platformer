# Platformer
This Repository contains the Source code for the game "Shades of Death", A 2D platformer game that I made using C# and Unity. The Sprites of the projects are made in GIMP, A photo editing software. The game is available on https://velkur.itch.io/

Note: The Repository DO NOT contain any Animation files or sound files which I used in my game. If you want to use this source code then you might want to create new sound files and Animations according to the theme of your game.

Best Wishes.
